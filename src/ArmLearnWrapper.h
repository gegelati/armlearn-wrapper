/**
* LearningEnvironment to use armLean in order to learn how to move a robotic arm.
* It inherits from LearningEnvironment to be used by Gegelati as an environment,
* and from DeviceLearner to access motors of the arm
* This double inheritance results in useless methods but it isn't a real problem.
*
* At the beginning, the arm is placed at startingPos. The goal will be to reach a target :
* targets[0]. targets is a list of targets that can rotate at each new simulation
* (see method reset)
* At each frame, the TPG is asked to take a decision based on the input
* (currently pos of motors and distances between arm and target on x, y and z).
* It decides to move a motor in one direction from a fix
* angle, or to do nothing. Then, its inputs are updated and it goes on.
* The simulation is stopped after something like 1000 frames, and we
* take the negative distance arm-target as score.
